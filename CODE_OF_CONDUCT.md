# Code of Conduct

## Summary

The LearnToCodeApp group is an unincorporated group of individuals collaborating on a project. Accordingly, there are no foundational or constitutional documents governing conduct.

Similarly, there are no employment or service contracts between the collaborators.

The administrators of the group therefore reserve the right to exclude collaborators from the group, prevent them contributing to discussions or contributing code. The group may continue to use any existing contributions. The administrators may choose to report the group member to the provider of any of the technologies we use (for example, report behaviour to Github) or to the relevant authorities. The administrators will only do so if the offending behaviour breaches the terms of use of the provider or is likely to comprise a serious criminal offence. 

Administrators will base any decision to exclude a member of the group on this Code of Conduct. When this code is not clear or ambiguous, administrators will give group members the opportunity to make representions. Or in other words, the admins will ask other members' opinions before deciding the code means something which is not obvious. The administrators' decision will however be final.

Everyone has different opinions and attitudes; we are unlikely to agree on where "the line" is when it comes to offensive language. This is not a private group so please take care to minimise any offence your comments might cause. We do not intend to be censorious. We simply ask that you are considerate of other members.

## Discrimination

The group intends to create an equal opportunities collaboration environment.

This means that members will be treated equally, regardless of their circumstances or personal characteristics.

Personal characteristics include:

- gender;
- sexual orientation;
- disability;
- physical appearance;
- body size;
- race/ethnicity/heritage; or
- religion.

This list may be more extensive than those protected by law in your country. Regardless, this Code of Conduct will apply.

## Standards



We will not tolerate harassment or bullying, regardless of whether it is based on a personal characteristic.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience:

- Swearing should be minimised - please remember that words can be more offensive in one country than another.
- Language or comments that are discriminatory based on a personal characteristic are not permitted (eg, sexist comments).

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any communication and/or talks.

Be kind and do not insult or put others down. Remember that the purpose of this group is to help people learn. This means some group members will have much lower levels of understanding than you. They may also be communicating in a second, third or fourth languge. Please therefore be patient with members who ask questions, even if the answer seems basic or obvious.

These are the values to which you should aspire:

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
- Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
- Be thoughtful
- Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
- Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
- In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree for the sake of it.
- When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behaviour:

- Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
- Unconstructive criticism: try not to criticise unless you can suggest a better approach. Bear in mind that other people may not agree with your criticism. Offer the suggestions in a polite way.
- Snarking (sarcastic, pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
- Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
- Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioural and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Reporting an incident

If you believe someone has breached this Code of Conduct, please report it to an administrator. The group admins are coloured red on Discord. You should do so via a private message.

It will help the admin to investigate the potential breach if you include the following information:

- Name and team of the participant doing the harassing
- The location or technology in which the incident occurred (eg, Github or Discord etc)
- The behaviour that was in violation and, if not obvious, why you think it is a violation of this Code of Conduct 
- The approximate time of the behaviour
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

If you believe an admin has breached this Code, report it to a different administrator. There is no need to inform the offending admin, the issue will be broached by another admin.

Admins should:

- Maintain a private record of all complaints.
- Take each complaint seriously. Even where a complaint seems trivial, a problem has arisen so resolution should be encouraged.
- Not inform the person accused of the breach if the complainant is not happy for them to (except where there is a significant breach which cannot be ignored). If the complaint is not pursued, this should be recorded against the complaint.
- Not jump to conclusions - each side must be given the chance to give their side of the story.
- Seek to keep decisions consistent with past decisions unless there is a real and significant reason not to do so.
- Not allow the complainant a deciding say in any disiplinary action.
- Keep both the complainant and the accused updated as to the progress of any investigation and give reasons for any decision made. Full reasons for the final decision should be recorded against the complaint.
